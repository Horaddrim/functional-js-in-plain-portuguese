# Functional JS in plain Portuguese

This is a educational repo, that I've made beside the article on my Medium account!

Here there is just an example of how to write some tests, and maybe, make a better functional code 
within existing applications!

## How to run the tests!

**OBS.: Just make sure you have the `git` CLI installed, and either Node.js and `npm`**

You just have to run this commands to make this guy right here works:

* `git clone https://github.com/Horaddrim/functional-js-in-plain-portuguese`
* `cd functional-js-in-plain-portuguese`
* `npm install`
* `npm test` or `npm t`

And enjoy the magic! :sparkling_heart:
